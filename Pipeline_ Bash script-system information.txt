The console output you provided is the result of running the Jenkins freestyle project. Let's break down the information displayed:

- "Started by user akram": This line indicates that the build was initiated by the user "akram".

- "Running as SYSTEM": This line indicates that the build is running with the permissions of the Jenkins system user.

- "Building on the built-in node in workspace /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Jenkins-pipeline-fs-01": This line shows that the build is running on the Jenkins built-in node (the Jenkins server itself) and specifies the workspace directory where the build is being performed.

- "[Jenkins-pipeline-fs-01] $ /bin/bash /tmp/jenkins15985751996219229692.sh": This line indicates the command that is being executed as part of the build. In this case, it is running a Bash script located at `/tmp/jenkins15985751996219229692.sh`.

- The lines following the script execution are the output generated by the script itself. Here's a breakdown of the output you shared:
  - "Hostname: ip-172-31-41-190.ap-south-1.compute.internal": This line displays the hostname of the Jenkins server.
  - "Date: Thu Jun 15 12:40:54 UTC 2023": This line shows the current date and time when the script was executed.
  - "CPU usage: 6.2": This line indicates the CPU usage percentage at the time of execution.
  - "Memory usage: 447 MB": This line displays the memory usage in megabytes.
  - "Disk usage: 0% used on tmpfs" and "37% used on /dev/xvda1": These lines show the disk usage percentages for different disk partitions.
  - "Network interfaces: ..." provides information about the network interfaces available on the Jenkins server, including their names, statuses, IP addresses, and other details.

- "Finished: SUCCESS": This line indicates that the build completed successfully without any errors.

The console output provides a summary of the build process and the results produced by the executed script.
